certificate-authority
=====================

## Overview

A tool for creating and managing a functioning intranet certificate authority.
Designed to live in a small encrypted file container.

## Usage

Use the `data/globals.sh-sample` as a template to create `data/globals.sh` :

    # Private Key Length
    BITS=2048

    # Nickname will be the CN of the certificate
    NICKNAME="Widgets Incorporated Root CA"

    # Organization or company name
    ORGANIZATION="Widgets Incorporated"

    # Country code
    COUNTRY="US"

    # CA certificate URL (optional, comment out if not used)
    CRT_URL="pki.widgets.com/root.crt"

    # Certificate revocation list URL (optional, comment out if not used)
    CRL_URL="pki.widgets.com/root.crl"

Generate CA key, certificate and other data :

    ./authority-generate.sh

    The '/media/crypt/data/private/random_seed' is missing, making a new one
    Generating an openssl configuration file in /media/crypt/data/generated.cnf
    Generating a 2048 bit private RSA key
    Generating a self signed certificate with for Widgets Incorporated Root CA
    The CA serial number tracker is missing, a new one will be generated.
    The CA revocation number tracker is missing, a new one will be generated.
    The CA index is missing, a new one will be generated.
    All done, you can now distribute '/media/crypt/data/Widgets Incorporated Root CA.crt' to your users

Generate a certificate for one of your servers :

    ./request-generate.sh ilo.example.com
    Generating a 2048 bit private key
    Generating a certificate signing request
    Generated CSR with the filename '/media/crypt/data/ilo.example.com/ilo.example.com.csr'
    If you now wish to sign it, use:
    No aliases:          ./request-sign.sh ilo.example.com
    Web server alias:    ./request-sign.sh ilo.example.com www.ilo.example.com
    Wildcard:            ./request-sign.sh ilo.example.com *.ilo.example.com

Sign the request with the certificate authority :


    ./request-sign.sh ilo.example.com *.ilo.example.com
    Generating a /media/crypt/data/conf/usr_cert.cnf openssl config file
    Including DNS alias: *.ilo.example.com
    Generating an openssl configuration file in /media/crypt/data/generated.cnf
    Using configuration from /media/crypt/data/generated.cnf
    Check that the request matches the signature
    Signature ok

## Tips

Keep your private keys, private. Save them on encrypted storage such as TrueCrypt or keep them
on a machine that's isolated from the network with resonable physical security.
